# IoTDashBoard
IoT Course Final Project

This project is using the flask framework so the need to install flask in rpi is a must

to install flask:

1. Open your terminal
2. run the command: sudo apt install python3-flask

This is if you don't have flask on your RPi but most likely, you already have it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In some part of trying to run the code, you might encounter an error on your gpio.

to fix this:

1. Open your terminal
2. run the command: sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio

This probably means that you don't have the required version of gpio.
